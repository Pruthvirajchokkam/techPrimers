			Wiki was introduced into the lexicon by a computer programmer named Ward Cunningham in 1995 when he created collaborative software that he called WikiWikiWeb. Wiki is Hawaiian for “fast; quick.” As a noun, wiki means “a website that allows anyone to add, delete or revise content by using a web browser.”
